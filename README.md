A simple notebook demonstrating capabilities of a low rank gradient approximation algorithm.

You will also find an implementation for a DDP communication hook which approximates gradients and all gathers the results.

In the future, we expect to add a JAX implementation.

Please read the notebook for more information: [notebook](imagenet_results.ipynb).
